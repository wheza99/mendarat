# Theme 60 - Volcanic Cosmos

## Overview
Theme 60 presents a spectacular "Volcanic Cosmos" experience that merges the raw power of volcanic eruptions with the infinite majesty of cosmic space. This theme captures the epic scale of universe-shaping volcanic forces that forge stars, planets, and entire galactic systems.

## Design Concept
- **Primary Colors**: Deep volcanic reds, molten oranges, and cosmic yellows with stellar accents
- **Visual Style**: Epic cosmic volcanic landscape with floating lava particles and stellar formations
- **Animation Style**: Powerful, dynamic movements mimicking volcanic eruptions and cosmic energy flows
- **Typography**: Bold, commanding fonts with fiery gradient text effects

## Key Features

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Volcanic gradients (red-950, orange-950, yellow-900)
- **Accents**: Molten lava colors (red-500, orange-400, yellow-400)
- **Text**: Fiery oranges and reds with cosmic yellow highlights

### Unique Animations
- `volcanic-float`: Powerful floating movement like volcanic debris
